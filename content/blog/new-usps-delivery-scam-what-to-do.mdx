# New USPS delivery scam: what to do

Scammers are now pretending to be USPS with fake delivery notifications. They claim you have a package that requires "redelivery fees" or "customs clearance."

## What the scam looks like

- Text or email saying: "Your package from Amazon/ebay/etc is held at the post office"
- Asks you to pay a small fee ($10-50) to "release" the package
- Provides a link to pay or a phone number to call
- Creates urgency: "Pay within 24 hours or package returns to sender"

## Why it's dangerous

USPS never asks for payment via text or email for standard deliveries. They also don't hold packages for "customs clearance" on domestic mail.

## What to do

1. **Don't click any links** in the message
2. **Don't call numbers** provided in the message
3. Check your actual USPS account at usps.com
4. If you were expecting a package, contact USPS directly using the number on their official website

## Real USPS communications

- Come from official @usps.com email addresses
- Never ask for payment via unofficial channels
- Provide tracking numbers you can verify on usps.com

Stay safe: When in doubt, go directly to the official website or app.
