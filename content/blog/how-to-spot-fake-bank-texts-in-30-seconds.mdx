# How to spot fake bank texts in 30 seconds

Bank scams via text message are one of the most common ways scammers try to trick people. But there's a simple way to check if a text is really from your bank.

## Step 1: Check the sender

Real banks never text from random numbers. They use official sender IDs like "Chase" or "Bank of America". If it's from a weird number like +1234567890, it's probably fake.

## Step 2: Look for urgency

Scammers create panic: "Your account is locked!" or "Action required in 15 minutes!" Real banks give you time and don't threaten immediate closure.

## Step 3: Never click links in texts

Legitimate banks won't ask you to click links in texts to "verify" or "unlock" your account. They direct you to use their official app or website.

## What to do instead

If you're worried about your account, open your bank's official app or call the number on the back of your card. Don't use any numbers from the suspicious text.

Remember: Your bank already has your information. They don't need you to "confirm" anything via text.
