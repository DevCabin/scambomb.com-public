# Three questions to ask before you click

Links in emails and texts can lead to dangerous websites. But you don't need to be a tech expert to stay safe. Just ask yourself these three questions.

## 1. Did I expect this message?

If you get an unexpected email about "your account" or "a package delivery," be suspicious. Legitimate companies don't send random alerts. If it's about something you actually ordered or have an account for, check your official account first.

## 2. Does the link match the company?

Hover over (don't click) the link. Does the URL match the company's official website? For example:
- Real: amazon.com/returns
- Fake: amaz0n-support.com/update

Scammers use similar-looking domains to trick you.

## 3. Does it create urgency or fear?

Messages that say "Act now or lose access!" or "Your account will be suspended!" are red flags. Real companies give you time and don't threaten immediate consequences.

## Safe alternatives

Instead of clicking suspicious links:
- Type the company's website address directly into your browser
- Use their official app
- Call them using a number from their official website (not from the message)

## Bonus tip

If something feels off, it probably is. Trust your instincts and take the safe route.
